# Feide Utstyrbase
For VÃ¥gen VGS, might be possible to use for other schools with some modifications - for now this fits our needs, but will most likely not fit yours.

## Setup
README coming soon.

- Register app at Dataporten
- Set callback url to `https://<your-domain>/login/feide/callback`
- Setup https://github.com/VaagenIM/EtikettServer (Currently not optional)
- Only supports SMTP for now.
- Run the `docker-compose.yml` file after setting up the environment variables.

Must be accessed through a reverse proxy, as the server does not support https. Use something like NginxProxyManager. Port `5000` is exposed.

If you need a kiosk mode, set up a separate reverse proxy with a valid access control (see NgixnProxyManager) and set the `KIOSK_MODE` environment variable to the FQDN of the proxy.

## TODO:
- [ ] Prettier frontend (`booking.html` needs more work)
- [ ] Move to a proper database?
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Docs
- [ ] Docker
